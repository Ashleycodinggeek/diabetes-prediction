# AshleyAI – Diabetes Prediction App

This is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in female patients based on medical diagnostic measurements. The model was trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a reliable classification model that assists healthcare professionals in early diabetes diagnosis using key health indicators like glucose level, BMI, age, and more.

## 📦 Dataset
- Source: [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle/UCI)](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- Features: 8 medical predictors (`Pregnancies`, `Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `SkinThickness`, `Insulin`, `BMI`, `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`, `Age`)
- Target: `Outcome` (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn (for model training)
- Streamlit (for web deployment)
- Pandas & NumPy (for data handling)
